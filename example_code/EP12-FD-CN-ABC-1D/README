Absorbing Boundary Conditions, Hadley

A) Main.m

First: Use CrankNicolson NOT CrankNicolsonABC

1. Run with Parameters
2. Run with Parameters1, (longer step) results in a failure
3. Run with Parameters3, (sharper angle) failure is immediate
   

4. Change method: CN to CN_ABC and test with both parameter sets.
   Note: CN_ABC contains a bit more robust ABC implementation.

B) Test.m

Illustrates:
1. Breaking of the ABC by "confusion" (najprv bez lepsej metody)
2. Nonlinearity of the ABC

Things to try: Vary relative intensities of the two beams.
