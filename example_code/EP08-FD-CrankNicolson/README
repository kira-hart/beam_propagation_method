1. Main.m    = the same as for implicit (in EP071)
2. Method.m  = completely analogous to implicit, note coeff. modifications
3. Test.m    = compare with the same run as for implicit
               ... making sure that Parameters1.m are the same in both cases

4. ConvergenceStudy2.m 
   compare with the counterpart in implicit: with the same parametrs it
   highlightes the superior rate of convergence in C-N

5. DispersionStudy.m
   compare with the implicit:
   a) full dispersion curve visible    
   b) all wavenumbers equally well defined (they have similar lifetimes)
   c) Q: this time we can see a rectangular texture. Its origin
      will obviously be similar to that in the Maxwell case. 
      What is it?
