This exercise package is meant as a help for the
Project on the Iterated Crank-Nicolson method.

This is a fully vectorial source in c/c++ and
shows one possible implementation. This particular
program aims to emphasize the conceptual similarity
to the method of lines in that the core of the algorithm
only requires a definition of what appears on the
right-hand side of the propagation equation.

For the purposes of the project, one can simplify the
task to the semi-vectorial approximation --- the
structure of the method remains the same [however note
that its numerical behavior may be different: it is
relatively difficult to break the SV version, while
the FV version may exhibit instability more readily]
