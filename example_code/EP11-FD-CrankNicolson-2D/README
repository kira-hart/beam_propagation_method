Parameters0.m :  
computationally inexpensive demonstration of code correctness

Parameters1.m : 
Longer wavelength with other params kept unchanges shows improved accuracy
                 
Parameters2.m : 
Propagation with sharper focus reveals grid anisotropy

Parameters3.m : 
Attempt to reduce anisotropy of the numerical solution.
Needs smaler beam diameter to reduce high transverse wavenumbers.
Compare runs with w0 = 0.5e-3 and 0.75e-3 ...
