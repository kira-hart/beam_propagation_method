This EP illustrates ADI BPM
(Gauss beam diffraction, comparison with the analytic target)

the ADI scheme:
src -> E00
TDM_Apply:  R00  =  LPX*E00
TDM_Solve:          LMY*E12 = R00
TDM_APPLY:  R12  =  LPY*E12
TDM_Solve:          LMX*E11 = R12
E11-> tar

Test1: Use parameters1.cc, and time the execution.
Compare running time, and results, to the 2D CN-BPM
utilizing direct sparse solver of Matlab (EP11).

Test2: Use parameters2.cc, and compile. Compare the
final solution real-part map with that obtained in
EP11. This case is to highlight the anisotropy induced
by the lattice. Which of the two algorithms suffers
more from the grid anisotropy?


Numerical Dispersion

dispersion_ADI_BPM.cc implements the white-noise method 
to measure the numerical dispersion curve. The "curve" is 
in fact a surface, due to two transverse dimension. To
keep things simpel,  we only measure the k_y=0 trace of
this surface.
