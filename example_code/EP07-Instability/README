p1.m Illustrates:

* Attempt to implement an explicit FD beam propagation 
  (paraxial beam propagation equation)

Explore: 

1. No matter what the input parameters, propagation never reaches any "useful distance".
   step 25 micron -> 1-2 mm propagation
   step 5  micron -> 3-4 mm propagation

2. Instability grows from noise even for a very smooth initial condition

3. If the initial condition contains a cusp (e.g. at the domain boundary),
it seeds the unstable growth very quickly (use a wide beam to see this).
try:  waist 40 -> 140 micron   

Lesson: 
A) unstable method is useless
B) instability shows up fastest with "sharp features"
   This observation useful for: 'stress tests' e.g. when one can not determine stability properties explicitly
