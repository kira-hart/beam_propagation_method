This demonstration:


Brute-force measurement of numerical dispersion relation:
  YeeDispersion_1.c
this program counts steps between zewro-crossing of the field
observed at a select grid point (for initial condition forcing
a sharp spatial frequency).

Verification of the three-point result for numerical dispersion
  YeeDispersion_2.c
