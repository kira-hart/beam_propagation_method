1.
Main + Parameters0 = diffracting solution (needs ABC, here functioning nicely)

2.
Main + Parameters1 = nonlineaority ON,
  a) Parameters1: demonstrates stable soliton
  b) modify Nz --- compare error (note the order of NL approximation)
  c) modify dx --- compare error

3.
Main + Prameters_angle = propagation at angle
  a) base run --- modest but evident error
  b) increase NX to 450 -- compare error
  c) decrease NZ to 50  -- only modest increase of error

4.
Main + Pars2, Pars3 = Higher-order solitons
   * also check 4th and 5th order in the notes

5.
Main + Pars_GaussIC
  a) base run --- nearly periodic but stable

6.
Main + Parameters_G_unstable  = instability for a long step
